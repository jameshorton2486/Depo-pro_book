# Style Bible v4.0 — Mastering Legal Transcription

## Core Principle
This is a published book, not a training manual. Every page must read like it was written by a veteran voice writer with 15 years of courtroom experience. The 3-Layer Method (rule → stakes → transcript example) is the invisible skeleton. The reader never sees "Layer 1" or "Bridge:" — they just experience well-structured, compelling prose.

## The Book Test
Before any content is considered done, apply this test: "If I printed this page and handed it to a voice writer sitting in a deposition waiting room, would they keep reading — or would they put it down?" If they would put it down, rewrite it.

## Voice
- Veteran voice writer mentoring a colleague — not a professor lecturing a class
- Professional but warm; authoritative but encouraging
- Second person ("you") for instruction; first person only in "From the Record" anecdotes
- Confident and direct: "The standard is..." not "Some reporters prefer..."
- Takes positions. Backs them up. Never wishy-washy.
- Never condescending

## Prose Style
- **Prose paragraphs are the default.** Bullet lists and numbered items are prohibited as body content.
- Stories and human moments teach better than checklists.
- Every rule needs a "what happens when you get this wrong" moment.
- Transitions between subsections are invisible — natural sentences, not labels.
- No meta-commentary: never "In this section, we will discuss..."

## Reading Level
- Target: Grade 10–12 (Flesch-Kincaid)
- Maximum 25 words per sentence
- Define legal terms naturally within sentences on first use
- Plain English over academic language: "use" not "utilize," "then" not "subsequently"

## Required Terminology
| Use This | Never This |
|----------|-----------|
| voice writer | stenomask reporter |
| digital reporter | electronic reporter |
| speech recognition engine | voice recognition |
| CAT software | reporting software |
| scopist | editor (in this context) |
| verbatim | word-for-word |
| impartiality / fairness | fairity (not a word) |

## Audience Focus
This book is for **voice writers and digital reporters**. Content must never:
- Reference steno machines or stenographic shorthand as the reader's method
- Use CSR (Certified Shorthand Reporter) as a credential for the reader
- Assume the reader uses a steno keyboard
- Describe workflows that only apply to stenographic methods

Voice writers use stenomasks and speech recognition engines. Digital reporters use audio recording equipment. The book addresses both.

## Structure Rules
- Open every section with a "From the Record" STORY (2–3 paragraphs of narrative — not a summary)
- Each subsection: bold rule → stakes/story → transcript example (NO visible labels)
- Natural prose transitions between subsections (NO "Bridge:" labels)
- End with "From the Record: Real-World Examples" + 2–3 Practice Challenges
- Maximum 1–2 callouts per subsection, formatted as blockquotes
- Never stack callouts; always 2+ paragraphs of prose between them
- Never more than 2 rules before a transcript example
- Tables in narrative: maximum 5–6 rows; larger tables go in appendices

## Content Integrity
- Never include fabricated case citations. If uncertain, describe the scenario generically.
- Never invent statistics. If no verified source exists, describe trends qualitatively.
- Never create fictional named individuals (e.g., fake foreword authors, fake experts).
- All case citations, rule references, and standards must pass fact-checking.

## Formatting
- `##` section title, `###` subsections, `####` sub-subsections
- Fenced code blocks for transcript examples (with line numbers and Q/A indentation)
- Blockquotes with bold label for callouts: `> **Pro Tip:** [advice]`
- `[DIAGRAM: description]` and `[TABLE: description]` for graphic placement

## Prohibited in Output
- "Layer 1 — The Rule:", "Layer 2 — Why It Matters:", "Layer 3 — Transcript Example:"
- "Bridge:" before transition sentences
- "[CALLOUT: Pro Tip]" or "[CALLOUT: Common Pitfall]" markers
- "Practice Challenges: See the end of the section."
- Stacked callouts without prose between them
- One-line "From the Record" summaries (must be narrative scenes)
- Bullet-point lists as primary content format
- "In this section, we will discuss..." openings
- Duplicated content between subsections
- "fairity", "inconfirm", or other non-words
- Passive voice for instructions
- References to stenographic shorthand, steno machines, or CSR credentials
- Fabricated case citations, statistics, or named individuals
