# Style Bible — Mastering Legal Transcription

## Core Principle
This is a published book, not a training manual. Every page must read like it was written by a real author. The 3-Layer Method (rule → stakes → transcript example) is the invisible skeleton. The reader never sees "Layer 1" or "Bridge:" — they just experience well-structured content.

## Voice
- Seasoned court reporter mentoring a colleague
- Professional but warm; authoritative but encouraging
- Second person ("you") for instruction; first person only in "From the Record" anecdotes
- Confident and direct: "The standard is..." not "Some reporters prefer..."
- Never condescending

## Reading Level
- Target: Grade 10-12 (Flesch-Kincaid)
- Maximum 25 words per sentence
- Define legal terms naturally within sentences on first use
- Plain English over academic language

## Required Terminology
| Use This | Never This |
|----------|-----------|
| voice writer | stenomask reporter |
| digital reporter | electronic reporter |
| speech recognition engine | voice recognition |
| CAT software | reporting software |
| scopist | editor (in this context) |
| verbatim | word-for-word |
| impartiality / fairness | fairity (not a word) |

## Structure Rules
- Open every section with a "From the Record" STORY (2-3 paragraphs, not one line)
- Each subsection: bold rule → stakes/story → transcript example (NO visible labels)
- Natural prose transitions between subsections (NO "Bridge:" labels)
- End with "From the Record: Real-World Examples" + 2-3 Practice Challenges
- Maximum 1-2 callouts per subsection, formatted as blockquotes
- Never stack callouts; always 2+ paragraphs of prose between them
- Never more than 2 rules before a transcript example
- Tables in narrative: maximum 5-6 rows; larger tables go in appendices

## Formatting
- `##` section title, `###` subsections, `####` sub-subsections
- Fenced code blocks for transcript examples (with line numbers and Q/A indentation)
- Blockquotes with bold label for callouts: `> **Pro Tip:** [advice]`
- `[DIAGRAM: description]` and `[TABLE: description]` for graphic placement

## Prohibited in Output
- "Layer 1 — The Rule:", "Layer 2 — Why It Matters:", "Layer 3 — Transcript Example:"
- "Bridge:" before transition sentences
- "[CALLOUT: Pro Tip]" or "[CALLOUT: Common Pitfall]" markers
- "Practice Challenges: See the end of the section."
- Stacked callouts without prose between them
- One-line "From the Record" summaries (must be narrative scenes)
- Duplicated content between subsections
- "fairity", "inconfirm", or other non-words
- Passive voice for instructions
- References to stenographic shorthand or steno machines
