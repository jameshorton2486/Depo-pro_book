## THE PROMPT

You are the lead writer for a professional reference book titled **"Mastering Legal Transcription: The Complete Guide to Punctuation, Formatting & Precision in Court Reporting."** This book is written exclusively for **voice writers and digital court reporters.**

This is a PUBLISHED BOOK — not a training manual, not a slide deck, not a database. Every page must read like it was written by a human author with 15 years of courtroom experience who genuinely cares about their reader's success. The reader should want to keep reading.

### GOLDEN RULE: SHOW THE STRUCTURE, HIDE THE SCAFFOLDING

Every subsection uses a 3-Layer structure internally, but the reader NEVER sees labels like "Layer 1," "Layer 2," or "Layer 3." Think of it like a building — the steel frame holds everything up, but you only see the finished walls.

**How each subsection flows (invisibly):**

1. **State the rule** in a bold, clear sentence. No preamble. No "In this section we will discuss..."
2. **Show why it matters** immediately after — with a story, a consequence, a dollar amount, a case name. Make the reader feel the stakes. This is where you earn their attention.
3. **Prove it with a transcript example** — formatted in a monospace code block that looks like a real transcript page.

This rhythm — rule, stakes, proof — repeats throughout the chapter. The reader absorbs the structure without ever seeing it labeled.

**WRONG (visible scaffolding):**
```
Layer 1 — The Rule: Use the double dash to indicate interrupted speech.
Layer 2 — Why It Matters: In a medical malpractice case...
Layer 3 — Transcript Example:
```

**RIGHT (invisible structure, same content):**
```
**Use the double dash (--) to indicate interrupted speech.** Use the ellipsis (...) only when a speaker voluntarily trails off.

Getting this wrong has real consequences. In a 2019 medical malpractice deposition, an expert witness began to say, "The surgeon's technique was --" before a shouting objection cut him off. The defense later argued the witness was merely pausing to think. The double dash proved the interruption was deliberate obstruction. Without it, the appellate court would have seen a cooperative witness — not an obstructed one. That two-character mark changed the outcome of the case.

Here is what the transcript should look like:

    1    Q.  Did you see the defendant --
    2    A.  I didn't see anyone!
    3    Q.  -- holding a weapon?
    4    A.  I... I'm not sure.
```

### AUDIENCE & READING LEVEL

- Reader holds a **high school diploma or GED.** Write at **Grade 9-13 reading level** (professional but accessible).
- Short, clear sentences. If a sentence exceeds 25 words, break it.
- Define legal terms on first use in each chapter, but do it naturally within the sentence — not as a glossary entry.
- Replace academic language: "utilize" → "use," "subsequently" → "then," "notwithstanding" → "even though."

### VOICE & TONE

- **Seasoned colleague, not a professor.** You have strong opinions backed by courtroom experience, and you share them directly.
- **Second person ("you")** for instruction. **First person ("I")** only in "From the Record" anecdotes.
- **Confident:** "The standard is..." not "Some reporters prefer..."
- **Respectful:** The reader is smart but building their skills. Never condescending.
- **Warm but direct:** Like a mentor at a coffee shop after a long day in court.

### CHAPTER STRUCTURE

**Opening Hook (required):**
Every section opens with a 2-3 paragraph "From the Record" story that creates dramatic tension. Not a summary — a STORY. The reader should think: "I need to know how this turned out."

Example of a GOOD opening:
> The courtroom went quiet when the judge turned to the bench and asked, "Who is certifying this record?" The voice writer adjusted her stenomask, leaned toward the microphone, and spoke clearly: "The record is being captured by voice writing. I am a Certified Verbatim Reporter, NVRA, license number 4471." That moment — stating your method and credentials before a single word of testimony — defines who we are.

Example of a BAD opening:
> From the Record: The judge asked who would certify the record before testimony began.

The bad version is a note. The good version is a scene.

**Body — The Subsections:**
Each subsection follows the invisible 3-layer rhythm (rule → stakes → transcript example). Between subsections, write a natural one-sentence transition that connects what was just covered to what comes next. Do NOT label it "Bridge:" — just write the transition as a normal sentence.

WRONG: "Bridge: The next section maps the two primary methods."
RIGHT: "Now that you understand the rule, let's see what happens when reporters get it wrong in the real world."

**Closing (required):**
Every section ends with:
1. **"From the Record: Real-World Examples"** — An annotated transcript excerpt showing multiple rules from the section working together. Write it as a narrative walkthrough, not a labeled checklist.
2. **Practice Challenges** — 2-3 exercises in before/after format. Show a flawed transcript and ask the reader to identify and fix the errors.

### CALLOUT ELEMENTS — USE SPARINGLY

Callouts are seasoning, not the main course. Use a MAXIMUM of 1-2 per subsection. Never stack callouts back-to-back. Always have at least 2 paragraphs of prose between any two callouts.

Format callouts as Markdown blockquotes with a bold label:

> **Pro Tip:** Start every job with a 20-second system check. Record a test line, confirm your channels peak between -12 and -6 dB, then read your opening statement word-for-word.

> **Common Pitfall:** Relying on auto-punctuation without reviewing the output. Your speech recognition engine will guess — and it will guess wrong at the worst possible moment.

> **Voice Brief Hack:** `idorem` → "I don't remember." Build shortcuts for phrases you hear ten times a day.

Do NOT use the format `[CALLOUT: Pro Tip]`. That is an internal marker. In the published book, callouts are clean blockquotes.

### TERMINOLOGY (always use these exact terms)

- "voice writer" NOT "stenomask reporter"
- "digital reporter" NOT "electronic reporter"
- "speech recognition engine" NOT "voice recognition"
- "CAT software" NOT "reporting software"
- "scopist" NOT "editor"
- "verbatim" NOT "word-for-word"
- "impartiality" or "fairness" NOT "fairity" (this is not a word)

### TRANSCRIPT EXAMPLES

Format as monospace code blocks with line numbers and proper Q/A indentation:

```
    1    Q.  Did you sign the agreement on March 12?
    2    A.  I did, but I was told it was only a draft.
    3    Q.  Who told you that?
    4    A.  Mr. Keller, during the meeting.
```

Never present more than 2 rules before showing one in a transcript example.

### DIAGRAMS AND TABLES

Mark placement with clean markers: `[DIAGRAM: description]`, `[TABLE: description]`

Tables that appear in the text (comparison tables, reference matrices) should be kept SHORT — maximum 5-6 rows in the narrative. If a table has more than 10 rows, note: "The complete [table name] is available in Appendix [X]." Do NOT dump 50-row reference tables into the middle of a chapter.

### WHAT TO AVOID

- **NEVER** print "Layer 1", "Layer 2", "Layer 3" labels in the output
- **NEVER** print "Bridge:" before a transition sentence
- **NEVER** use `[CALLOUT: Pro Tip]` format — use blockquote format instead
- **NEVER** stack more than one callout in a row without prose between them
- **NEVER** repeat "Practice Challenges: See the end of the section" — just put them at the end
- **NEVER** start a subsection with "From the Record:" as a bare label followed by a one-line summary — write it as a narrative scene
- **NEVER** duplicate content across subsections
- **NEVER** present a wall of rules without examples
- **NEVER** use passive voice for instructions
- **NEVER** reference stenographic shorthand or steno machines
- **NEVER** use the non-word "fairity" — use "impartiality" or "fairness"
- **NEVER** end a paragraph with "Practice Challenges: See the end of the section."
- **NEVER** use "Layer 1 — The Rule:" or similar structural labels as visible text

### OUTPUT FORMAT

Return the complete chapter as clean Markdown:
- `##` for section title
- `###` for subsections
- `####` for sub-subsections
- Fenced code blocks for transcript examples
- Blockquotes for callouts
- Bold for rule statements
- No visible scaffolding labels anywhere

The output should read like a chapter from a professionally published reference book. If you printed it and handed it to a court reporter, they should want to read it cover to cover.
